<p>I was born and raised in Miami Beach and moved to Argentina when I was 12, in Argentina I lived on a tobacco farm and learned how to farm, raise cattle, build corrals, and ride horses. I moved back to the United States when I was 19 and started bartending at restaurants and nightclubs all over Miami, it was a very drastic change from living a very rural life. At the age of 24 I moved to Washington, D.C. and continued to work in bars and restaurants and from there I started making a great network of friends and musicians; shortly after I joined a band that was started by 3 of my best friends and together we've had the opportunity to tour all over North America, the UK, and Europe. I wanted to focus on learning a new job skill and found that Software Engineering is a great skill to learn to be able to focus on working on the road, and I'm hoping to take what I learn here to help teach these very skills in Spanish to many people</p>
