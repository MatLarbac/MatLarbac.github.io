For years I've worked in the restaurant industry and I always found myself stuck in the same place, not being able to advance and that really took a toll on my personal mental health. Several years ago a really good friend of mine left the service industry to follow a career in computer science and moved to Tromso, Norway and for years I envied him for doing that. I spoke with him over the holidays in December and I told him how happy I was for him to do that and how much work and dedication over many years it must've taken him to achieve that; and to my surprise he told me that he initially took a bootcamp course earlier in the year before applying to job openings overseas. From that moment I knew I could follow in his footsteps and made the deision to apply to this course so I can get to where I see myself in the next 5 years
